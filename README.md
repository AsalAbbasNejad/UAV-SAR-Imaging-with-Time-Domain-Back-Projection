# ðŸ›° Radar Imaging using Time Domain Back Projection (TDBP)

This MATLAB project reconstructs Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images using the **Time Domain Back Projection (TDBP)** algorithm. The data is collected via UAV-based radar, and the project includes signal processing techniques for range resolution, image focusing, despeckling, reflector-based resolution analysis, and trajectory noise impact assessment.

##  Project Structure

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `dataset_UAV.mat` | Dataset containing radar signals, UAV trajectory, reference range axis, etc. |
| `range_resolution.m` | Calculates theoretical range resolution using Î”R = c / (2B) |
| `range_resolution_energy.m` | Estimates bandwidth from signal energy in frequency domain and computes Î”R |
| `tdbp_reconstruction.m` | Main image reconstruction using TDBP + runtime analysis |
| `despeckling.m` | Reduces speckle noise using moving average filters (3Ã—3, 5Ã—5, 7Ã—7) |
| `corner_reflectors.m` | Analyzes focused SAR patch and computes azimuth & range resolution |
| `trajectory_errors.m` | Simulates increasing UAV trajectory noise and visualizes impact on SAR image |
| `Asal_Abbasnejadfard_HW2_10974178.pdf` | Report explaining methodology, results, and key visualizations |

##  Key Concepts

- **TDBP Algorithm**: High-resolution SAR imaging by integrating radar returns over a 2D grid.
- **Range Resolution**: Assessed using both known bandwidth and estimated from signal FFT.
- **Despeckling**: Moving average filters help reduce speckle noise while preserving detail.
- **Corner Reflectors**: Used to evaluate range and azimuth resolution performance.
- **Trajectory Error Simulation**: Demonstrates how UAV motion errors distort image quality.

##  How to Run

1. Open MATLAB.
2. Ensure all `.m` files and `dataset_UAV.mat` are in the same folder or in your MATLAB path.
3. Run each script separately to view results:

```matlab
run('range_resolution.m')
run('range_resolution_energy.m')
run('tdbp_reconstruction.m')
run('despeckling.m')
run('corner_reflectors.m')
run('trajectory_errors.m')
